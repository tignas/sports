Net Points=(Points Produced)-(Points Allowed)

8. Points Allowed
Points Allowed=[(DefensiveRating/100)*(.2*{(MinutesPlayed/(TeamMinutes/5)}*TeamPossession))]

9. Players Non Scoring Possessions
Non-Scoring Possessions Formula=(Player's Field Goal Attempts)-Player's Field Goal Made)+0.4*(Free Throw Attempts)+(Player's Turnovers)

10. Scoring Possessions Formula
Scoring Possessions Formula=(Field Goals Made) - 0.37*(Field Goals Made)*Q/R + 0.37*(Player Assists) + 0.5*(Free Throws Made)

Q=5*(Player Minutes)*(Team Assist Total)/(Team Total Minutes)-(Player Assists) 
R=5*(Player Minutes)*(Team Field Goals Made)/(Team Minutes)-(Player Assists)

11. Players Total Possessions
Player's Total Possessions Formula=(Player's Scoring Possessions)+(Player's Non-Scoring Possessions)=(Player Field Goal Attempts)-(Player Missed Shots)*(Team Offensive Rebounding Percentage)+0.37*(Player Assists)-0.37*(Field Goals Made)*Q/R+(Player Turnovers)+0.4*(Player Free Throw Attempts)
Q=5*(Player Minutes)*(Team Assist Total)/(Team Total Minutes)-(Player Assists) 
R=5*(Player Minutes)*(Team Field Goals Made)/(Team Minutes)-(Player Assists)

12. Points Created
Points Created= PTS + AST * (2-VBP) + (REB + STL + BLK) * VBP -(FGMiss + FTMiss + TOV) * VBP – 0.5 * VBP * PF 
VBP = the value of ball possession is league’s average points per 100 possessions.

13.Win Score
PAWS=Position Adjusted Win Score=[(PAWS48/48)*Minutes]

PAWS48 =PAWS per 48 minutes=[WS48 – Average WS48 at primary position played]

WS48 =Win Score per 48 minutes

14. Total Rebound Percentage
Total Rebound Percentage=100*(Total Rebounds*(Team Minutes Played/5))/(Minutes Played*(Team Total Rebounds + Opponent Team's Total Rebounds))

15. Seasons Left Formula
Seasons Left Formula=27-0.75*(Age of The Player) 

16. Steal PCT
Steal Percentage=100*(Steals*(Team Minuted Played/5))/(Minuted Played*Opponent's Possessions)

17. Tendex Formula
The Tendex Formula=[(Points)+(Rebounds)+(Assists)+(Steals)+(Blocks)- (Missed Field Goal Attempts)-0.5*(Missed Free Throws)-(Turnovers)-(Fouls)]/(Player's Minutes)

18. Touches
Touches=Field Goal Attempts + Turnovers + (Free Throw Attempts / (Team's Free Throw Attempts/Opponents Personal Fouls)) + (Assists/0.17)

%Pass = 100 * (AST / 0.17) / Touches. The percentage of a player's touches that ended with him passing to a teammate in an attacking position on the floor.
%Shoot = 100 * FGA / Touches. The percentage of a player's touches that ended with him taking a shot and not being fouled in the act.
%Fouled= 100 * (FTA / (Tm FTA / Opp PF)) / Touches. The percentage of a player's touches that ended with him drawing a foul.
%TO = 100 * Turnovers / Touches. The percentage of a player's touches that ended with him turning the ball over.

Trade Value Formula=[(Approximate Value- 27-0.75*Age )^2( 27-0.75*Age +1)*Approximate Value]/190+(Approximate Value)*2/13

20. TS PCT
True Shooting Percentage Formula=(Player's Total Points)/[(2*(Player's Field Goal Attempts+ 0.44*Player's Free Throw Attempts)]

21. Usage PCT
Usage Percentage Formula=100*[(Team Minutes)/(5*(Player Minutes))]*[(Field Goal Attempts)+0.44*(Free Throw Attempts)+(Turnovers)/[(Team Field Goal Attempts)+0.44*(Team Free Throw Attempts)+Team Turnovers)]
